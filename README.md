# As-Built Printer

## üßæ What is this?

**As-Built Printer** is a custom Python-based printing tool designed to automate and streamline the printing of technical documents in a structured, repeatable way ‚Äî ideal for industrial or construction environments.

## üß† Why did I build this?

I imagined and developed this tool as a practical solution to meet the **real operational needs of a company** that deals with large volumes of structured PDF documents, such as:

- Manuals  
- Technical sheets  
- Certifications  
- Assembly guides  
- Guarantees  
- Reports  
- and more...

The traditional process of manually opening, sorting, and printing each file is repetitive and time-consuming.  
This tool solves that by **automating the printing logic** and applying a predefined order to document types, ensuring **consistency, accuracy, and speed**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- Automatically detects all required folders and files
- Supports multi-copy printing
- Silent printing using SumatraPDF
- Sorts documents logically (prioritizes numbered files)
- Handles exceptions like missing DUAO files
- User-friendly interface with printer preferences
- Includes custom branding and clickable credits

## ‚úÖ Benefits

- Saves **valuable time** for employees
- Ensures **uniformity** in print sets
- Reduces **human error**
- Easily deployable as a single `.exe` file
- Simple and intuitive to use ‚Äî no training required

## üí° Notes

- Built with `tkinter` and compiled using `pyinstaller` with `--onefile` mode.
- The application icon is embedded into the `.exe`.
